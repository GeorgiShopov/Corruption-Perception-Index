# Corruption Perception Index

#### Transparency International is a global movement working in over 100 countries to end the injustice of corruption.

#### The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is the most widely used global corruption ranking in the world. It measures how corrupt each country’s public sector is perceived to be, according to experts and businesspeople.

#### Each country’s score is a combination of at least 3 data sources drawn from 13 different corruption surveys and assessments. These data sources are collected by a variety of reputable institutions, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.

## The data sources used to compile the CPI specifically cover the following manifestations of public sector corruption:
- #### Bribery
- #### Diversion of public funds
- #### Officials using their public office for private gain without facing consequences
- #### Ability of governments to contain corruption in the public sector
- #### Excessive red tape in the public sector which may increase opportunities for corruption
- #### Nepotistic appointments in the civil service
- #### Laws ensuring that public officials must disclose their finances and potential conflicts of interest
- #### Legal protection for people who report cases of bribery and corruption
- #### State capture by narrow vested interests
- #### Access to information on public affairs/government activities

## The CPI does not cover:

- #### Citizens’ direct perceptions or experience of corruption
- #### Tax fraud
- #### Illicit financial flows
- #### Enablers of corruption (lawyers, accountants, financial advisors etc)
- #### Money-laundering
- #### Private sector corruption
- #### Informal economies and markets
